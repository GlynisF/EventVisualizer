### *<ins>Project Statement</ins>*

***Problem:***<br>
On a broader scale, the ethos of DIY culture is rooted in limited or no access to the
resources and tools needed to achieve a goal. Small-scale event planners (with a focus on music events) embody this
philosophy, turning challenges like lack of industry experience, location, and commercialism—common barriers to 
entry—into opportunities for innovation. Rather than seeing these limitations as setbacks, DIYers view them as a 
silver lining, using them as fuel to adapt creatively and bring their visions to life. In contrast, larger
operations with commercial backing or established names follow proven strategies and rules to ensure success, but it’s 
the resourcefulness of the DIY community that drives their unique approach to achieving goals.\
\
However, many current event planning tools, such as Eventbrite—the most popular platform—are designed with larger 
commercial entities in mind. While Eventbrite facilitates event planning, its emphasis on client-side interaction, 
ticket sales, reporting analytics (like sales and customer reach/retention), and marketing campaigns does not address 
the primary concerns of DIYers. DIY event planners need tools that help them organize their unique ideas and customize 
the planning process to fit their specific needs, rather than focusing on ticket sales and revenue tracking.<br><br>

***Solution:***<br>
*DIY Event Visualizer* is a resource designed for the resourceful. It offers a flexible,
customizable blueprint tailored specifically for DIY event planners. Unlike platforms
like Eventbrite that prioritize sales and analytics, the DIY Event Visualizer focuses on
creative freedom and adaptability, giving DIYers a place to house their ideas and
customize the planning process. By covering the basics of event planning and allowing
for personalization, it empowers DIY planners to turn their creative visions into
reality, while overcoming the unique challenges they face without relying on
traditional, sales-focused tools.
