### <ins>Project Statement</ins>

Problem
: On a broader scale, the ethos of DIY culture is rooted in limited or no access to the
resources and tools needed to achieve a goal. Small-scale event planners embody this
philosophy, turning challenges like lack of industry experience, location, and
commercialism—common barriers to entry—into opportunities for innovation. Rather
than seeing these limitations as setbacks, DIYers view them as a silver lining, using
them as fuel to adapt creatively and bring their visions to life. In contrast, larger
operations with commercial backing or established names follow proven strategies and
rules to ensure success, but it’s the resourcefulness of the DIY community that drives
their unique approach to achieving goals.\
\
However, many of the current event planning tools, such as Eventbrite—the most
popular platform—are designed with larger, commercial entities in mind. While
Eventbrite allows for event planning, its focus is on selling tickets and providing
analytics based on sales, which are not primary concerns for DIYers. DIY event
planners need tools that help them organize their unique ideas and customize the
planning process to fit their specific needs, rather than focusing on ticket sales and
revenue tracking.

Solution
: *DIY Event Visualizer* is a resource designed for the resourceful. It offers a flexible,
customizable blueprint tailored specifically for DIY event planners. Unlike platforms
like Eventbrite that prioritize sales and analytics, the DIY Event Visualizer focuses on
creative freedom and adaptability, giving DIYers a place to house their ideas and
customize the planning process. By covering the basics of event planning and allowing
for personalization, it empowers DIY planners to turn their creative visions into
reality, while overcoming the unique challenges they face without relying on
traditional, sales-focused tools.
